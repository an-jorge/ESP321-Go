# AES 128-bit

## Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a widely used encryption algorithm designed to protect sensitive data. It is a symmetric key encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data, as opposed to [asymmetric key encryption](https://www.portnox.com/cybersecurity-101/what-is-public-key-encryption/), where different keys are used for encryption and decryption. AES is known for its efficiency, security, and versatility, making it a global standard for securing digital information.

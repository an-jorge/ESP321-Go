## ADC

### Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)

An analogue to Digital Converter is a data converter that allows digital circuits to interface with the real world by encoding an analogue signal into a binary code

### What is the purpose of using an ADC?

1. Signal Digitization: The primary purpose of an ADC is to convert continuous analog signals (such as voltage or current) into discrete digital values. This is essential for processing analog signals in digital systems, such as computers and microcontrollers.
2. Data Processing: Digital signals can be easily manipulated, stored, and transmitted. ADCs enable the processing of real-world signals (like audio, temperature, and pressure) in digital form, allowing for complex computations and analyses.
3. Interface with Digital Systems: Many modern devices, such as sensors and communication systems, output analog signals. ADCs allow these devices to interface with digital systems, enabling compatibility and integration.
4. Improved Accuracy and Noise Reduction: Digital processing can enhance the accuracy of measurements and reduce the impact of noise. Once an analog signal is converted to digital, various techniques can be employed to filter and enhance the signal quality.
5. Storage and Transmission: Digital signals can be easily stored in memory and transmitted over digital communication channels without degradation, making ADCs critical in applications where data integrity is important.
